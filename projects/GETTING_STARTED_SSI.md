# Getting Started with the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Projects

The Self Sovereign Identity Projects provide the building blocks for SSI work: verifiable credential issuance and
verification, decentralized identifiers, and an in-the-box SSI Service. These projects
are also used in the Decentralized Web Platform (DWP).

This work is led by @decentralgabe. You may engage with our growing community:

In-flight! ✈️

## Summary

Milestone 2 is about component-level minimum viability. It lets us 
make demos and examples, and begins
integration. This sets up our next phase: bringing these 
components together into a cohesive 
[Web5](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5) Platform. That in turn 
will form the basis for the 
[tbDEX](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/tbdex) application.

## Goals

* Deliver MVP APIs for Components:
  * [`dwn-sdk-js`](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js)
  * [`ssi-service`](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service)
  * [`ssi-sdk`](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk)
  * DID (Decentralized IDs) SDKs
* Launch Public Programs:
  * [Developer Web Site](https://developer.tbd.website/)
  * [Tutorial and Example System](https://forums.tbd.website/t/tutorials-and-examples-system/89)
  
## Community Benefit

At the close of this Milestone, community members should be able to:
* Call upon the published APIs for the components
* Build examples and demos showcasing the SSI and DWN features
* Contribute those examples and demos to be published on the Developer Web Site
* Begin work with the core development team on integration of components into the Web5 Platform

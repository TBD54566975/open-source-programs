# TBD Community Working Model

## Roadmap

The [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) is expressed as a list of milestones. It 
provides teams with enough direction to make decisions for their projects,
while making for regular sync points so that code, programs, and people can 
integrate at regular sync points. It's designed to give clarity to the community
about where we are and where we're going.

## Milestones

Milestones are encoded as a set of goals, defined by the
[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) model. Goals are:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-bound

Specificity is fluid. Because we are time-boxed, we make delivery estimates on
a best-case scenario and adapt as the milestone progresses. Work may have delays
due to any number of factors, and we employ a blameless culture when goals
must be rescoped. When we find our estimates are off, we simply communicate
our position to the team via Discussions where we can collectively assess impact
and adapt as necessary.

Relevance may also be fluid, leaving room to adapt our work to the changing
needs of the community. We reduce disruption here by releasing Milestones at
frequent, predicable intervals (typically 6-8 weeks).

Milestones will have minimum requirements, and in these cases we prioritize
work around themes. Missing a theme indicates a loss of focus and can hold up
others, so we take care to communicate our objectives here and stay true to them
during development.
